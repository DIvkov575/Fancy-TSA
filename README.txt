TODO:
 1) Get more data
 2) Walk-forward analysis
    - 1yr windows -> check for stability
    - get Sharpe, draw-down, win rate
    - analyze these stats over time



Learned:
 - Sharpe: Risk-free-return / Volatility                                                                Determines RR ratio
 - Sortino: Risk-free-return / negative-volatility (asymetric movements -> only penalizes the losses)   Better RR Ratio
 - Drawdown: "A more interprettable volatility" -> can you psych survive the losses                     Interpretable "possible loss"
 - Win rate: many small wins -> more (psych) stable                                                     Stability
 - SQN: Risk + Trade# + return (2.5 Exceptional; 2 Good; 1 Mediocre; 0 poor)                            Comprehensive evaluation
 - CAGR: smooth compounding gains
 - Annualized returns: Straight forward when comparing year-year


IMO-Important:
 - Sortino
 - Win rate
 - SQN
 - CAGR
